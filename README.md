## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a responsive landing page inspired by Starbucks, focusing on layout structure, visual organization, and real-world responsiveness.

The project was developed to practice and consolidate HTML5 and CSS3 fundamentals, with special attention to CSS Grid, media queries, and adaptive behavior across different screen sizes.

Beyond visual fidelity, the goal was to understand how layout decisions impact usability, readability, and image behavior on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, following practices commonly used in real-world front-end projects.
