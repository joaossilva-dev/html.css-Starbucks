# html.css-Starbucks
Responsive Starbucks landing page built with HTML5 and CSS3 using CSS Grid and Media Queries.


The objective of this project is to build a responsive landing page inspired by Starbucks, focusing on layout structure, visual organization and real-world responsiveness.
The project was developed to practice and consolidate HTML5 and CSS3 fundamentals, with special attention to CSS Grid, media queries and adaptive behavior across different screen sizes.

More than visual fidelity, the goal was to understand how layout decisions impact usability, readability and image behavior on desktop, tablet and mobile devices, following practices commonly used in real front-end projects.
